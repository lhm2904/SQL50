| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
Explanation: 
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also, user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
```

### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans

| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```


### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT *
FROM weather AS w1 INNER JOIN weather AS w2

## Average Time of Process per Machine

```
Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.

(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.

machine_id is the ID of a machine.

process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.

activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').

timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.

'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.

The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.

It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |
+------------+------------+---------------+-----------+
Output: 
+------------+-----------------+
| machine_id | processing_time |
+------------+-----------------+
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |
+------------+-----------------+
Explanation: 
There are 3 machines running 2 processes each.
Machine 0's average time is ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = 0.894
Machine 1's average time is ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = 0.995
Machine 2's average time is ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = 1.456
```

### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT machine_id, ROUND(AVG(process_time)::numeric, 3) AS processing_time  
FROM (  
     SELECT machine_id, process_id, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS process_time  
     FROM Activity  
     GROUP BY machine_id, process_id  
     ORDER BY machine_id, process_id) process  
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.
```

### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT user_id,  
       ROUND(AVG(  
           CASE  
               WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1  
               ELSE 0  
           END),2) AS confirmation_rate  
FROM confirmations FULL OUTER JOIN signups  
    USING (user_id)  
GROUP BY user_id  
ORDER BY user_id;
```
