## User Activity for the Past 30 Days I

```
Table: Activity

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM (category) of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website. 
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.

 

Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
Output: 
+------------+--------------+ 
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+ 
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+ 
Explanation: Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.
```

### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT activity_date AS day,  
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users  
FROM Activity  
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN '2019-07-27'::date - INTERVAL '29 days' AND '2019-07-27'  
GROUP BY day  
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) > 0;
```

> [!NOTE]
> We subtracted 29 days out of the ending date instead of 30 because the ending date is included in the time frame.

| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+------------+------------+----------+-------+
| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
+------------+------------+----------+-------+ 
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |
+------------+------------+----------+-------+
```

### SOLUTION

**Method 1: Subquery**

```sql
SELECT product_id, year AS first_year, quantity, price  
FROM sales  
WHERE (product_id, year) IN (  
                            SELECT product_id, MIN(year)  
                            FROM sales  
                            GROUP BY product_id);
```

**Method 2: CTE**

```sql
WITH year AS (  
             SELECT product_id, MIN(year) AS year  
             FROM sales  
             GROUP BY product_id)  
  
SELECT s.product_id, s.year AS first_year, s.quantity, s.price  
FROM sales s JOIN year y  
    ON s.product_id = y.product_id AND s.year = y.year;
```


## Classes More Than 5 Students

```
Table: Courses

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| student     | varchar |
| class       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
(student, class) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of a student and the class in which they are enrolled.

 

Write a solution to find all the classes that have at least five students.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Courses table:
+---------+----------+
| student | class    |
+---------+----------+
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |
+---------+----------+
Output: 
+---------+
| class   |
+---------+
| Math    |
+---------+
Explanation: 
- Math has 6 students, so we include it.
- English has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Biology has 1 student, so we do not include it.
- Computer has 1 student, so we do not include it.
```

SOLUTION:

```sql
SELECT class
FROM (
     SELECT class, COUNT(student) AS student_count
     FROM Courses
     GROUP BY class
     HAVING COUNT(student) > 4) count;
```

> We can trim out the outer query and execute the count condition while selecting only one item:

```sql
SELECT class  
FROM Courses  
GROUP BY class  
HAVING COUNT(student) > 4;
```


## Find Followers Count

```
Table: Followers

| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |
+---------+-------------+
Output: 
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | followers_count|
+---------+----------------+
| 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1              |
| 2       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
Explanation: 
The followers of 0 are {1}
The followers of 1 are {0}
The followers of 2 are {0,1}
```

FROM Followers  
GROUP BY user_id  
ORDER BY user_id;
```


## Biggest Single Number

```
Table: MyNumbers

+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.

 

A single number is a number that appeared only once in the MyNumbers table.

Find the largest single number. If there is no single number, report null.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |

| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.

Example 2:

Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |

| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.
```

### SOLUTION

```sql
SELECT MAX(num) AS num  
FROM (  
SELECT num  
FROM mynumbers  
GROUP BY num  
HAVING COUNT(num) = 1) single_number;
```
